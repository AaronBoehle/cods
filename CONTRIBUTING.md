# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. I just have several guidelines for PRs:

- Respect the `.editorconfig` file (there's probably an editor plugin that can
  do this for you)
- (as best you are able) keep the docs up to date. If you change a cli api or
  add a new one, try to make sure the docs reflect this.
- Use [good commit messages.](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- Explain why the PR is necessary.
    A link to an issue is sufficient; if the PR does not relate to an issue,
    please explain why it is open. When in doubt, open an issue first to
    discuss.

Please submit all PRs to the `zgulde/tomcat-setup` repo on the master branch,
not the one on `gocodeup`.
